### Eloquent ORM
It is an ORM, used to interact with database. We can use raw SQL queries as well if needed.
[Eloquent ORM reference](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent)

```php
User App\Todo; //include todo Model
$todo = new Todo(); //create object of Model
$todo->title = "any title"; //set title for the todos
$todo->save(); //save into database using ORM
```

### Blate Template Engine
It is the template engine use by the laravel. It's simple and powerful. We can also use raw php in the blade template files. We can create custom components as well in the blade template. Template inheritance/partial is also very easy with the blade template. It has control structures like if, else, loops, etc.

### Laravel installation
If your application is running inside the Docker then first install the PHP Cli in the host operating system to interact with the composer and laravel artisan from host operating system.
>$ sudo apt install php7.4-cli

In order to install laravel first install the composer.
##### create new laravel project via composer
>$ composer create-project laravel/laravel app **//to install the latest version**

>$ composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel blog "5.4.*" **//to install the specific version**

The laravel app can be run the following command.
>$ php artisan serve

OR
Install apache2 and open the laravel project URL/public/ in the browser. Or create the vhost and add domain to /etc/hosts file. 
> https://laravel-project-url/public/

```txt
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName laravel-app.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/laravel_app/app/public
    
    # add the following otherwise the URL rewriting will not work.
    <Directory "/var/www/html/laravel_app/app/public">
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

#Add following domain to /etc/hosts file
127.0.0.1 laravel-app.com
```
### Basic Routing
**app/routes** is the directory where we can define the web or api or channels routes.

Following are the laravel routes methods.

```php
Route::get('path', callback);
Route::post('path', callback);
Route::put('path', callback);
Route::delete('path', callback);
```

### Views/Templates
**app/resources** is the directory containing the blade view. default extension for the blade template is **file.blade.php** 

Following is used to load the view in the routes from callback functions or controller methods.

```php
Route::get("/about", function(){
    return view('file');
    // return view('dir/file');
    // return view('dir.file'); //via . syntax
});
```

##### Dynamic route or route params

```php
Route::get("/user{id}/{name}", function($id){
    return $id . ' ' . $name;
});

// http://laravel-app/user/10/atif
```

### Controller
We have to use the controller with the routes to load view. **app/Http/Controller** is the controllers directory.

>$ php artisan make:controller PagesController **//Controller must be plural** 

```php
// to load the index method of the PagesController
Route::get("/", 'PagesController@index');
```

### .env file
this is the file where we set the application secrets.

Following is used in the blade templates to load the env/config from the .env file into blade template.

```html
<span>{{config('app.name', 'default value')}}</span>
```
